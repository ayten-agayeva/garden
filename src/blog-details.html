                <p><img src="images/A.svg" />So how did the classical Latin become so incoherent? According to McClintock, a 15th century typesetter likely
                    scrambled part of Cicero's De Finibus in order to provide placeholder text to mockup various fonts for a type
                    specimen book. As an alternative theory, (and because Latin scholars do this sort of thing) someone tracked down a
                    1914 Latin edition of De Finibus which challenges McClintock's 15th century claims and suggests that the dawn of
                    lorem ipsum was as recent as the 20th century. The 1914 Loeb Classical Library Edition ran out of room on page 34
                    for the Latin phrase “dolorem ipsum” (sorrow in itself). Thus, the truncated phrase leaves one page dangling with
                    “do-”, while another begins with the now ubiquitous “lorem ipsum”. So how did the classical Latin become so
                    incoherent? According to McClintock, a 15th century typesetter likely scrambled part of Cicero's De Finibus in order
                    to provide placeholder text to mockup various fonts for a type specimen book.
                </p>

                <p>It's difficult to find examples of lorem ipsum in use before Letraset made it popular as a dummy text in the 1960s,
                    although McClintock says he remembers coming across the lorem ipsum passage in a book of old metal type samples. So
                    far he hasn't relocated where he once saw the passage, but the popularity of Cicero in the 15th century supports the
                    theory that the filler text has been used for centuries.
                </p>

                <p>And anyways, as Cecil Adams reasoned, “[Do you really] think graphic arts supply houses were hiring classics scholars
                    in the 1960s?” Perhaps. But it seems reasonable to imagine that there was a version in use far before the age of
                    Letraset.
                </p>
                <h4>McClintock wrote to Before & After to explain his discovery;</h4>
                <p>“What I find remarkable is that this text has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since some printer in the
                    1500s took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book; it has survived not only four centuries
                    of letter-by-letter resetting but even the leap into electronic typesetting, essentially unchanged except for an
                    occasional 'ing' or 'y' thrown in. It's ironic that when the then-understood Latin was scrambled, it became as
                    incomprehensible as Greek; the phrase 'it's Greek to me' and 'greeking' have common semantic roots!” (The editors
                    published his letter in a correction headlined “Lorem Oopsum”).</p>
